    <h1>How to-Hardware Page</h1>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>This page will describe how to create a hardware page and the parts of a computer.  In the end it will turn out like this.</p>

        <h2>Step 1/Day 1</h2>
        <p>The first day I added all of my titles which the following topics.</p>
        <img id="harddwaretitles" src="header.png">
        <p> <h1>Motherboard</h1> <h2>CPU(Central Processing Unit)</h2> <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3> <h4>Hard Drive</h4>
       I then added a paragraph of background detail on what each product is and how they are fundamental to a computer and how they all connect with each other. I also created the image to a certain size so they would not be too small or big.  Then I lined the text with the image so it wouldn't be misplaced next to the image.

       </p>
    <h3>Step 2/Day 2</h3>
    <p>On the second day I started to work on adding images to my paragraphs with each image that is appropriate to the correct paragraph.  I also started to experiment with different types of borders and colors.  Then I put the finishing touches to it by picking an appropriate background color that looked good with my borders and the border colors.</p>
    <h4>Step 3/Day 3</h4>
    <p>Make sure to go back and check for any mistakes in your coding that will mess up something as little as a grammar mistake, or to misplacing your whole paragraph.</p>
