                <text>  My name is Tyler Wong.  I am a 10th grader at Summit Shasta High School.  I have been to many places but some of the places I have been to are Hawaii, Arizona, and Oregon.  I strive to do better in not only academics but sports too, some sports I play are baseball, volleyball, and basketball.  I also enjoy eating various types of food at any type of the day and I love to try new things out whether it’s food, activities, etc.  2 things I like are rice and my bed.  I like rice because almost every meal there is usually rice that’s a part of it.  It’s also unique because you can use rice for combinations of food like meat, vegetables, and even some sauces and spices.  I like my bed because I am able to do a lot of things on it like use my phone, read and even use my laptop to do my homework.  But most importantly it’s the most relaxing place I know where I can be alone and just relax and sleep.  2 of my favorite hobbies are volleyball and going out for walks. I like going out for walks because at Shasta we don’t have PE so it gets me exercise whenever I go for walks and I can walk to places like the park or food places and even my friends homes.  I like volleyball because I feel I get better at the game every time I play the sport and it means a lot to me because it’s just fun in general to play.  I got into playing volleyball when one of my friends invited me to play in a co-ed summer league with her and I haven’t stopped playing ever since.</text>
