                        Vindinium is a game in which you create your own AI to compete against others. The objective of the game is to collect as much gold in the round(Each round is consisted of 1200 turns) and you go against 3 other oppenents. The maps where the bots are played
                        on have mines which hold the gold, some maps have as few as 4 mines or even up to 20 mines if you get a larger map size. You collect the gold through the mines, each of the mines consist of 1 gold but overtime once you collect
                        multiple mines you then begin to accumilate lots of gold. You can also aquire gold by stealing a mine from a person and you know you have stolen it once the mine turns to your own color, and you can get gold by killing a person
                        who has mines. If you die and you have mines, the person who killed you gets those mines. Your HP is also a problem as whenever you grab a mine or you're attacked by a player you lose 20HP. You only have 100HP and already every
                        time you move you lose 1HP every step. To regenerate HP you will need to go to the tavern. The taverns cost 2 gold but they will heal 50HP for you each turn.

                           <p>This is the code I use to tell my bot to go to a mine. Mines enable the bots to gain gold because it is the <br>source of the gold.

                        <h3>What I learned this project</h3>
                        <p>I learned a lot more this project as these past few projects I struggled a bit as I was new to this coding idea, but now in the third <br>terminal things are begining to click for me as I am able to understand the code a lot more easier
                            now. And I believe that making this bot was a lot of fun and a good learning opportunity as I was able <br>to get some wins when I ran my bot against my peers. So, finally I learned that if I just apply myself to make my code better,
                            coding can be a lot of fun.</p>
