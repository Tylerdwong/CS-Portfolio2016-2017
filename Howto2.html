        <center>How to make a To do list</center>
        <h1>Step 1-HTML</h1>
        <p>My how to page needed javascript, html, and css in order to make it the best I can.  For the HTML on a to do list it is important that you want to see how you want to format your to do list to make it look the way you want it to look.  So what I did is that I added to style it the way I wanted the page to look with a dropdown button and a textbox to input my list of works, and even a submit button to make my to do list appear.  After this you want to create your options which are basically 4 of them to make the input that you put in the textbox have a special effect which in this case I have my list being underlined, green font, blue font, or a red border around the list.  In these options you want to make sure to id each of the options so later on you won't have to worry about not being organized.  You would also want to name your div which is very important part to work in with the javascript, in this case my div name is "outputarea."  </p>
